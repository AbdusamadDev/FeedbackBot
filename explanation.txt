update the way it gives options to the following way:

instead of just adding 3 buttons, the question texts should be taken from database, and inside the questions for example "most common questions", there should be sent another more buttons as subcategory of that question - "most common questions", and those should be also taken from database as foreign key and database structure follows as:
questions:
question_text
category_id
date_created (created time of question)
admin_id (admin from website)


category:
question_text (the smaller and more detailed  question added by admin)
answer_id
admin_id

answer:
question_id (which is in the base question, smaller and more detailed )
